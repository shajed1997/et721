Course Description
Software development practicum objective is to equip students with a solid foundation in programming fundamentals while fostering a mindset of exploration, inquiry, and teamwork. Throughout the course, students will apply their programming concepts learned in their previous programming courses, including essential concepts such as data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, functions, and object-oriented principles to deploy or create computer programs and application.

By delving into these fundamental building blocks of programming and exploring their applications within frameworks, students will gain a deep understanding of how software systems operate and how to manipulate them to solve real-world problems and create new programs. Through hands-on coding assignments, projects, and challenges, both individually and in teamwork, students will not only apply what they have learned but also gain practical experience in creating and refining programs. These practical exercises will enable students to uncover new insights and approaches to problem-solving, preparing them to tackle a wide range of technological challenges.

 

By the end of the course, students will have not only mastered the core principles of programming and their respective frameworks but also developed a lifelong passion for exploration and innovation in the realm of technology.
